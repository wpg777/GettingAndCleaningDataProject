GettingAndCleaningDataProject
=============================
The files located here are related to the project for a course "Getting and Cleaning Data" from the coursera.org site.

It contains the run_analysis.R script which should be run from the directory containing the data from the experiment http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

If the working directory is different, please modify the "data_directory" variable.
'plyr' library is required to run the script. It outputs the summarization.txt file in the working directory which contains a average of all the relevant variables, grouped by subject and activity.

For the description of the data, please consult the CodeBook.md file in the same directory.
